# Python-For-Data-Science
Get started with basics of python
Learned different python concept and applied my basic learning in the questions mentioned in the file.
The file contains ten question that is easy to done with python library such as Numpy, pandas but
I used basic python for better understanding and deeper knowledge of python.
Because it can be helpfull later to develop end to end projects in machine learning models and deep learning projects
